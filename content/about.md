= About

My name is Evan Brass.  I like to think of myself as a web developer - although this is the only real website I have.  Most of my web development time is spent working on little web-based doodads.  There should be a projects section around here somewhere that talks about what I've made, how I made it, and what inspired me to work on it.

In addition to programming, I've dabbled in knitting, soap making, and sourdough bread.  I shave with a double edged safety razor because it's cheaper and requires less single use plastic.

If you discover that we are interested in some of the same things then please let me know!
